Feature Summary:

This is an application that animates a world of bugs and plants.

Plants grow over time and and can be eaten by bugs.

The bugs move around the space, get hungry over time and eat plants if they are hungry.

Growth and hunger levels of plants/bugs are represented by their size and the image that represents them.
